# MARIO 2.0


### About the project:
> I want to note that I took this idea and the cassettes for the project from a YouTube blogger: 
> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ClearCode/playlists"> `Clear Code` </a>. 
> My goal was to improve the code and make it more flexible (which I successfully managed!). 
> This code was written completely from scratch!

> The project clearly demonstrates the ability of Patton and his PyGame library to work with 2D games. 
> I spent a little more than 4 days on it. The game features `6` levels that open up as you progress.
